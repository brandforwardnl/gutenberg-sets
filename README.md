# Gutenberg Sets

Create reusable sets of Gutenberg blocks and patterns, and insert them into posts/pages via a simple sidebar UI.

## Features

- Manage sets as a dedicated post type (`Gutenberg Sets`).
- Insert a set into any post/page/CPT from the Gutenberg sidebar.
- Optional visual preview of the set content in the sidebar.

## Usage

1. Go to **Gutenberg Sets** in the WordPress admin menu.
2. Add a new set and build its content in the block editor.
3. Edit a post/page and open **Gutenberg Sets** in the editor sidebar.
4. Click **Add to page** to insert the selected set.

## Notes

- Sets are stored as `gdb_set` posts.
- Sidebar previews are rendered from the set's block content.
